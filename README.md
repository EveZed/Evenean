# Orthogonal Latin Square Generator
Eve's Python script to generate orthogonal latin squares.   
Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column. Two Latin squares of the same size (order) are said to be orthogonal if when superimposed the ordered paired entries in the positions are all distinct.
